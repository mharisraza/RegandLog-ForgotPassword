# Register & Login Form With Forgot Password Functionalities.

This project provides a registration system with both client-side and server-side validation, as well as a forgot password functionality. It uses Java, Servlets, and JDBC to handle the back-end logic and store user information in a database.

## Dependencies

- Java 8 or higher
- A database system compatible with JDBC (e.g. MySQL)

## Setup

1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a new database and user account with appropriate permissions.
3. Update the `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` constants in the `DBConnection` class with the details for your database.
## Usage

1. Start the server by running the `Run as [Server]`.
2. Open the `index.jsp` file in a web browser to access the registration form.
3. Fill out the form and submit it to register a new user.
4. Use the "Forgot Password" link to request a password reset if necessary.
